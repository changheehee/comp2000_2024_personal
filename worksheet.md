Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/

- First person to commit: Matthew Roberts

repository B (GitHub) (according to GitHub repository initial commit history):

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
