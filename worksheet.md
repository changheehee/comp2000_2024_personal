Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
    - GitHub is a code hosting platform optimized for open source and private projects, providing a user-friendly interface and rich community support.
      Bitbucket's strong integration with team-level collaboration and the Atlasian family (Jira, Confluence) gives enterprise project management advantages.
      Based on user needs, GitHub is suitable for open source and private projects and Bitbucket for team-based collaboration and enterprise projects. 

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

  **repository A (Bitbucket)**:

    * The last person to commit: Matthew Roberts
    * First person to commit: Jon Mountjoy

  **repository B (GitHub) (according to GitHub repository initial commit history)**:

    * The last person to commit: Erhannis
    * First person to commit: BaptP

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

  **Repository A (Bitbucket)**: 
    * The project's current status should be verified on Bitbucket. If there are no recent commits, the project might be inactive.

  **Repository B (GitHub)**: 
    * The last commit was on Oct 6, 2022, indicating the project is not actively developed at the moment.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

    * Repository A: Files in the src directory have the most changes, showing that the main codebase is maintained there.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

~~~~~
Red vs. Blue

My **Main.java** located:
***comp2000_2024\comp2000_2024\src\Main.java***
